                <h1>Sebastian Brandt</h1>
                <p>Hi there, my name is Sebastian. Welcome to my web project I created for my Front end Development course.
                    <br>In this project I chose to use the API from</br> 
                    <a id="catfacturl" href="https://catfact.ninja/">https://catfact.ninja</a>.
                    <br>One of the requirements was to use a tokenless API which
                    <a id="catfacturl" href="https://catfact.ninja/">https://catfact.ninja</a> provides, no registration etc.</br>
                    <br>As for what I like to do in my free time, I enjoy playing video games and reverse engineering games. I've written several cheat clients in C# (mostly single-player games) also known as "trainers".</br>
                    <br>My largest project was a cheat client for a game called VRChat, the game itself had many security flaws and no anti-cheat so it was a good game to learn more about reverse engineering.</br>
                    <br>The project with all the code and information about features can be found <a id="catfacturl" href="https://github.com/sebrandt1/ScuffClient">>HERE<</a> if you'd be interested in seeing the code. (Its over 2000 lines)</br>
